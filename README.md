The R script MCMCalgorithm.R is an auxiliary file that contains the mcmc implementation of the proposed approach described in Section 3.4 of the paper and in the supplementary material.

The R script Hoel1972_runMCMC.R shows how to use mcmc implementation provided in MCMCalgorithm.R using the Hoel (1972) data. The supplementary material provides a detailed analysis of the Hoel (1972) data using the proposed approach.

The R script Hoel1972_plots.R contains the code needed for creating the figures in the supplementary material related to the analysis of the Hoel (1972) data.

The R scripts beta_example.R, binomial_example.R, and normal_example.R contain the code needed for creating the figures associated with the examples in the main text.
